## 🚀 Implementation Steps

### 1️⃣ Preprocess & Explore Dataset
- Download dataset (MNIST, CIFAR-10, or Cats vs. Dogs)
- Normalize, resize, and visualize samples

### 2️⃣ Build & Train CNN
- Implement a CNN using TensorFlow/Keras
- Train on dataset and monitor **accuracy** and **loss**

### 3️⃣ Data Augmentation & Evaluation
- Apply transformations: rotation, flipping, zoom
- Evaluate with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix

### 4️⃣ Transfer Learning Optimization
- Fine-tune a pre-trained model (e.g., MobileNetV2)
- Compare results with baseline CNN

### 5️⃣ Document & Present
- Provide all scripts, trained models, visualizations, and README
- Record a short demo video and prepare a presentation

## 📊 Example Outputs
- Training & validation accuracy/loss curves
- Confusion matrix for classification performance
- Sample predictions with true vs. predicted labels
- Performance comparison between CNN & transfer learning model
